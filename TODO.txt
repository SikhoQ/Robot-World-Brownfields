TODO:
change obstacles cmdLine arg to accept a variable number of obstacles

DOING:
-create WorldObjects class to store the objects of the world as a single entry/entity.
-create WorldRepository interface to define operations that can be performed on the domain models,
 abstracting away the data access logic.
-create DBWorldRepository class to implement WorldRepository -> contains data access logic for
 interacting with the database.
-use repository interface in domain logic to interact with the data, keeps domain logic clean and
 unaware of the data access implementation.
-add setters in World for world objects, to use when restoring the world
